Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: as.person(c(
    "Bob Verity <r.verity@imperial.ac.uk> [aut, cre]"
  ))
Description: Every time I make a change to a script I update the version number
    at the end of the script. This should mean that projects can use the most 
    up-to-date version of my functions, while at the same time it is possible 
    to trace exactly where a version controlled script came from came from.
